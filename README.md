## Features
- A Waypoint Editor for creating and modifying bot's waypoints of traversing the map. Have a look at [Using the Waypoint editor](/raw/bw-assets/wpedit.md).

- A clean and nice menu, you can edit every bot DVAR within in-game.

- Everything can be customized, ideal for both personal use and dedicated servers. Have a look at [Documentation](#Documentation) to see whats possible!

- This mod does not edit ANY stock .gsc files, meaning EVERY other mod is compatible with this mod. Mod doesn't add anything unnecessary, what you see is what you get.

- Loading waypoints from CSV files, and if the CSV file is missing, will download the CSV from [this repo](https://github.com/ineedbots/piw5_waypoints) automatically.
